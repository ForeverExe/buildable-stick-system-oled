# TODO

Notes for "next time".

## v4

* Engraving some cosmetic stuff? Or maybe a place to mount other plates?
* Try making it so top plates are bolted in from the side of the frame rather than the top
    * I'm thinking of abandoning this, because it makes the frame more complicated to have a portion of a column rather
      than the full column, but I'll keep it here for a bit longer

## Forked V4
* [x] Add a prototype for an oled module to subtract the exact geometry
* [ ] Try printing a plate with the plastic pins to see if it works
* [x] Make a standard hitbox layout for both left and right plates
  * [ ] Make the buttons decorative plates

* What about using something like door hinges to access the inside?

## Vx

* [ ] Take a journey into making the case shorter for slimmer builds
    * [ ] Find a way to move or rethink of side buttons
    * [ ] Resize the USB-B cable connector, 90% sure it'll change to a standard usb-a/c port, need to know if usb-b is needed for the lever
    * I'm thinking to add a keyboard hole module, so if the case is slimmer it should not be too crowded like using classic arcade buttons or something printed like OSBMX
